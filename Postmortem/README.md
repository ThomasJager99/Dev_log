## Structure
Each postmortem follows this structure:
1. **Incident Date** — When the issue happened.
2. **Affected Service** — Which service, application, or component was impacted.
3. **Incident Description** — Summary of what happened and why it was a problem.
4. **Step-by-Step Resolution Process** — Chronological list of actions taken, with commands and explanations.
5. **Lessons Learned** — Key takeaways from the incident.
6. **Prevention Plan** — Actions to avoid the same problem in the future.
7. **P.S.** — Optional notes (e.g., if the postmortem is in educational format).

## File Naming

## Notes
Some postmortems here may be written in **educational format** with very detailed step-by-step actions.  
Others may be shorter and focus on key points only.
