üîß Tools: ufw, nginx, apt, systemctl

________________

How It Started:

The idea was to install UFW, allow the necessary ports, and install nginx ‚Äî then put something on it to test locally in browser.

________________

The Fix:

1. Install simple firewall ‚Äî UFW

sudo apt update && sudo apt install ufw

Installation went successfully, nothing to complain about.
I allowed port 22 to maintain SSH connection and did it before enabling the firewall, like a smart move:

sudo ufw allow 22

This added a new rule: SSH is allowed.
And what I really like about UFW is its default policy ‚Äî everything is denied unless allowed.


2. Allow nginx to talk to the browser
Before enabling the firewall, I allowed another port:

sudo ufw allow 80

This is needed for HTTP.


3. Install and set up the web service ‚Äî nginx:

sudo apt install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

Although enable might not be necessary ‚Äî after installation, nginx was already set to autostart on boot (as seen in systemctl status).


4. Result:

After a couple of iterations, I managed to create a small useful website ‚Äî with all the links I need for my study.
A small win for me. But it‚Äôs the foundation for future things.

What I Learned

‚Ä¢ Always allow SSH before enabling the firewall.

‚Ä¢ ufw is dead simple and efficient ‚Äî good choice for minimal systems.

‚Ä¢ nginx installs fast and works out of the box.

‚Ä¢ Port 80 should be explicitly opened with ufw allow 80.

‚Ä¢ Even minimal Debian is capable of serving something useful in a couple of minutes.


‚úç Personal Note:
Little win for me. From here, I‚Äôll build up to more.
