üîß Tools: Cloudflare, Zoho Mail, AWS EC2, Elastic IP, Apache, Certbot (Let‚Äôs Encrypt)

________________


How It Started:

Today‚Äôs goal was to protect my website. I decided to start with Cloudflare and bought a domain name for my portfolio site. Cloudflare‚Äôs free plan also includes a free SSL certificate ‚Äî a nice bonus.

The Problem

To have a proper setup I needed:
- Email address for the domain
- DNS records for website + mail
- Static IP for my AWS instance
- SSL certificate installed directly on the server

The Fix

1. Domain + SSL via Cloudflare:
	
- Bought a domain on Cloudflare
- Activated free SSL included in the plan

2. Zoho Mail setup:

- Used Zoho‚Äôs free plan (5 GB/mailbox, up to 5 accounts)
- Authorized DNS with Zoho and added MX records (mx.zoho.eu)
- Configured priority levels (10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30) for redundancy
	
3. DNS Records:

- Added www as a CNAME alias
- Set MX for mail delivery
- Bound domain to AWS Elastic IP (so DNS won‚Äôt break after reboot)
	
4. Elastic IP:

- Allocated Elastic IP in AWS
- Attached it to the EC2 instance to prevent IP changes

5. SSL Certificate (Let‚Äôs Encrypt + Certbot):

- Installed certbot on the EC2 instance
- Generated SSL certificate with certbot
- Configured Apache to use HTTPS

What I Learned
- Cloudflare free plan already includes Universal SSL, but server-side SSL is still needed for full protection (Full mode).
- MX records define where domain mail goes, priority numbers ensure fallback order.
- Elastic IP is essential for stable DNS pointing to AWS.
- Certbot automates SSL certificate creation and Apache integration.
- Real setup = domain ‚Üí Cloudflare proxy ‚Üí AWS server with SSL.

‚úç Personal Note:
All of this was mostly for learning ‚Äî now my portfolio website has HTTPS, custom email, and proper DNS setup. Feels like a real production-grade project already.
