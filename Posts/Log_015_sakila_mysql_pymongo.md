# üé¨ Kino Search ‚Äî My First School Project  
*Graded 1 (Sehr Gut)*

> *‚ÄúIt started as a simple console movie search app.  
Then it became my first real experience of building something that actually works.‚Äù*

---

### I. The Beginning

This was my first school project ‚Äî a console application for movie search.  
I built it completely from scratch: no templates, no frameworks, no IDE automation.  
Just a terminal, a clean `.venv`, and a few libraries.

```bash
cd Projects/movie_search/
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pymysql pymongo python-dotenv tabulate

That‚Äôs where it all started ‚Äî the moment when theory turned into practice.

II. Connecting the Databases

I created a .env file for database credentials and added it to .gitignore.
My first test script didn‚Äôt work ‚Äî the school‚Äôs MySQL server was down.
Later it came back online, and my connection finally succeeded.

Then I connected MongoDB to handle logs.
A simple test created a document with my name and returned an ID.
That was the first ‚Äúalive‚Äù moment of the project.

III. SQL vs NoSQL

Working with both databases side by side taught me a lot:
	‚Ä¢	MySQL ‚Äî explicit open/close, manual sessions.
	‚Ä¢	MongoDB ‚Äî persistent client, automatic connection pooling.

Different rules, different personalities, one task: make them cooperate.

IV. Refactoring the Code

After a few tests the code became messy ‚Äî too many prints, repeated connections.
I cleaned everything up:
	‚Ä¢	Added _mysql_conn() encapsulation.
	‚Ä¢	Moved credentials and factories into config.py.
	‚Ä¢	Created log_writer.py for Mongo logging.
	‚Ä¢	Made each module communicate through config.py.

Now MySQL opens and closes cleanly for every query,
and MongoDB stays persistent through one global client.

V. Organizing the Project

To keep things under control, I expanded my PyCharm task markers:
TODO, WIP, BUG, NOTE, QUESTION.
Small detail, but it keeps focus on what matters.

VI. What I Learned
	‚Ä¢	How to manage two databases in one project.
	‚Ä¢	Why context managers matter for clean SQL sessions.
	‚Ä¢	How to refactor config and connection logic properly.
	‚Ä¢	How structure makes learning faster and calmer.

VII. Closing Thoughts

Kino Search was my first real experience of putting theory into code ‚Äî
a simple console app, but a complete working system.
It was later graded 1 (Sehr Gut) ‚Äî and that feels like a solid start.
